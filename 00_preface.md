# Preface

The following book was a short, sharp effort to write up an introduction to Middleman. Partly to help get down all the notes I made about Middleman, but also help other people get to grips with what I think is a really handy tool to build websites without using something more heavyweight like WordPress or Rails.

## Contents

The book is cut into the following chapters and sections:
