# Learning Middleman

This short book will show you how to create great websites, efficiently using Middleman.

Although the websites we will be building will be "static" (HTML, CSS with a little JavaScript) but we'll cover some features of Middleman that offer some really dynamic functionality.

By the end of the book you will have another useful tool in your armory that can help you quickly prototype and build websites. You should also be much more confident in accessing the Middleman documentation and know how to start building your own add-ons and code extensions.

> A static website generator is an application that helps you create HTML, CSS and JavaScript websites in a dynamic fashion. That is, a static generator helps you use other tools to speed up development, so Scss instead of CSS etc. and even programming languages such as Ruby or PHP

## Why Middleman

Middleman is an open-source ruby based static site generator.

There are many static website generators like Middleman, in any programming language of your choice, but rather than focus on relative strengths/weaknesses of all, the following are the some of the things I like about Middleman:

- Uses Ruby, an expressive, dynamic programming language
- Out of the box uses Scss (and Compass) requiring little setup
- Using a little yaml or json you can create generate hundreds of pages
- Strong project structure without being unnecessarily restrictive

Some of these things are very personal. I like Ruby and I like the way Middleman sets things up. I think you will too. Using a datafile like yaml or json however, is extremely useful. You

## Who this book is for

This book is written primarily for people in the early stages of their career creating websites and apps. You should know some HTML and CSS and have written a website or two, maybe with hand-crafted HTML etc. You should also have some exposure to a programming language. Ideally something like Ruby or JavaScript, but it matters not which one.

Above all, the thing that matters is that you are happy to Google anything you don't get right or want to know more about. This is advice not just about this book, but programming and building websites in general.

## About the author

The book is written by me, Andrew Duckworth. Below is my bio:

### Andrew Duckworth

Andrew Duckworth is a developer and writer/editor from England. Currently living in Sheffield, Andrew creates applications and leads all digital marketing products and platforms for the NHS (National Health Service) in Sheffield as the head of digital in a small agile team.

Before this he worked in publishing.

If you have read a few tech books in the last five years you may have read a book either commissioned, edited or inspired by Andrew. Some of these books has Andrew's name in it, many don't. Of the all the books he has had some hand in, his favorite were a Python computer vision title, the first published ElasticSearch book, a few titles about data science using Scala and Python and a book about Java EE 6 which he rescued from being thrown away forever, even if he knew nothing about Java at the time.

Andrew's primary programming languages are Ruby and PHP.

If you wish to get in touch with Andrew regarding your strategy for technical publishing, reviewing/editing a book or to chat about the state of publishing, [please feel free to drop him an email](mailto:grillopress@gmail.com).

## Getting in touch

If you notice any errors, of which I am sure there are some, feel free to get in touch with myself via [email](mailto:grillopress@gmail.com) or through [Github, where the book is hosted]().

Praise is very much welcome, which again [can be emailed through to me](mailto:grillopress@gmail.com), or alternatively, give the book a shout out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndrewDuck_) or wherever you place such things online.
